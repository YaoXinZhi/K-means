K-mean algorithm python implementation

default K = 5 , and test file is 'k-means data'

If you want to change the input file ,You can type the following code:

-f 'file path'

If you want to change the default K value , u can type the following code:

-k k_value


In order to represent the data iteration process, the unnecessary output is added in the last iteration, if you do not like, you can delete it .

Finally, look forward to any of your comments or suggestions for feedback.
